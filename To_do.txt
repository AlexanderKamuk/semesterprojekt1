To do:

Generel:
	- 3D-print improved LDR-box (Designed along with connectors and top shielding, needs printing)
	- Påbegynd rapport

Tracking:
	- Analyze new LDR values (done)
	- Introduce curved movement (test results in; needs work)

Logistics:
	- Remake electromagnet
	- Make PCB for electromagnet (designed, awaiting print)
	- Solder 5-LDR-PCB (soldered, short circuited, needs rewiring)
	- Make linear actuator (printed, awaiting assembly)
	- Make state machine for path planning (paused until hardware is produced)
